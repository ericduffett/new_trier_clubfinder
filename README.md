New Trier Clubfinder

## A mobile app to help students at New Trier High School search and filter clubs based on their interests and availability.

This app replicates the existing web version of the New Trier Club Finder so that students have it immediately available on their school-issued iPads and phones.

Project started in Spring 2022. Completed summer 2022.
